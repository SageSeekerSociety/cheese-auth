# cheese-auth

This repository is a standalone Authorization/Authentication library extracted from the cheese project. It offers a comprehensive, ready-to-use authentication solution that not only provides basic features such as email-based registration and password reset but also includes advanced functionalities like user avatars and mutual following between users.

The repository consists of two parts: the first is an Auth Server simplified from [cheese-backend](https://github.com/SageSeekerSociety/cheese-backend), and the second is an Auth library separated from [cheese-backend-nt](https://github.com/SageSeekerSociety/cheese-backend-nt), which can be used with the first Auth Server in any SpringBoot project.
